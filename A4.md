# **Discussion Activity** 

Read this opinion of one entrepreneurial author and discuss the questions below:

*A traditional business plan is head-centered; it's an exercise in what business owners think they should do. \**Traditional, head-centered, static business plans don't work.** **The business plan that will always work starts from a different place with a different set of operating assumptions. It starts from a heart-centered approach, which means it starts with experiencing the feelings you have.** Not only does this plan tolerate change, but it relies on your building in change as a key factor that will keep you on the best course. In the heart-centered business plan, we dream about the vision for the business. Why do you want to build it? Who will benefit? What will it mean to the world? Only after you understand those things, can you write any kind of tactical plan that will truly get you there.*

*The real difference between the business plan that always works and the traditional business plan is in how you think and feel about the plan—it's your attitude and your relationship to the plan that will make all the difference.*

 

## **Discussion Questions:**

- The statements shown in bold are very strong. Do you think this opinion merits consideration? Or does a financially sound business plan need to be based on more than “feelings”?
- Why would the idea of “a heart-centered approach” possibly be a problem when seeking a source of funding for the business?
- “What will it mean to the world?” - Does this question matter when considering options for a business plan?
- Have you ever put your heart into a job or a business and had it fail?
- When you planned your career path, or your business how detailed were you? Did you leave many openings in the plan to allow for unexpected issues? Or did you plan your every step?
