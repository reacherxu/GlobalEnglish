# **Discussion Activity** 

Look at the list of sentences below. Try turning them into either a positive statement, negative statement or question:

- *I have been doing this for hours.*
- *Has he been speaking?*
- *She has not been learning at all.*
- *What is one of your biggest worries at work?*
  - when deadline is approaching, still has much work to do
- *How do you overcome that concern?*
  - through work overtime

Now read the text below to your coach. Try to make it sound as natural as possible.

*Always, but especially during \**lean** times, effective sales professionals know the importance of **communicating value**. Budgets –if they ever were **discretionary**– are tighter. Business customers are being asked to **do more with less**. Decisions are increasingly less on WHERE to spend the money and more on WHY we need to spend the money.*

*Value is the \**customer’s perception of your worth**, excellence, usefulness, or importance with respect to them or their business. Value addresses the customer’s question, “What can this person or company do for me?” Even spending time on the phone with you must return something of value to the customer. You must **initially** and continually earn the right to have the customer invest their time and money with you.*



## **Discussion:**

- Can you explain what value is to the customer?
- Do you think that your company offers something of value to your customers or clients? Discuss with your coach.
- Is there anything that you do to maintain value in your customer’s eyes?
- What is something that you *don’t* value, that most people do?
