   I'm not sure what kind of resources would be helpful to my oral English, I think I need to practice more,listen more.

So I think listening and speaking resources would be benificial to me.

   Oral English, because in my career, once we need to produce a product, we need to communicate to the leaders in other countries, so once I can express my opinions correctly, it would be a great help, also business English is necessary. But in current situation, I just want to talk freely.

   Not that much, the first priority for me is to speak freely and express my opinions correctly.

11. What is the most challenging aspect about English for you in your job? Outside of your job?

    In my job, because in a meeting, there're people from other countries, they speak so fast with some unfamiliar words, so it's hard for me to catch up.
